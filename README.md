Hi, Iâ€™m Venkatesh, I love story telling. Finding interesting insights and sharing them with people.
Data Science has become a gateway for me to take my storytelling to the next level, bringing up new insights and having findings backed by hardcore data.
Not having a formal eduacation in this field I am navigating this vast domain picking up what I can as I go along, this makes it challenging but even more exciting. 

I am looking for interesting collaboration, with anyone interested in data science/analytics, I am sure it will be lot more fun than finding the way alone!
